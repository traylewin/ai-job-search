<h1>Senior Backend Engineer</h1>

<p>We believe the best tools disappear into your workflow. At Stytch, we're building
software that millions of people use every day, and we need engineers who care as much about
the craft of engineering as the product itself.</p>

<h2>The Role</h2>
<p>You'll join our Auth Platform team to build and scale the core systems behind Stytch.
This means working across the stack — from database internals to API design to real-time
collaboration features. You'll have significant ownership and autonomy.</p>

<h2>What you'll work on</h2>
<ul>
<li>Build and maintain core product features used by millions</li>
<li>Improve performance and reliability of our real-time systems</li>
<li>Design APIs and data models that are elegant and extensible</li>
<li>Collaborate closely with design and product in a small team setting</li>
</ul>

<h2>About you</h2>
<ul>
<li>5+ years of professional engineering experience</li>
<li>Strong full-stack skills (we use TypeScript, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL)</li>
<li>You care about user experience and product quality</li>
<li>You're comfortable with ambiguity and small team dynamics</li>
<li>You write clear, maintainable code and thoughtful documentation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compensation</h2>
<p>$175,000 - $225,000 base + equity + benefits</p>
