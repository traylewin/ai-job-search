# Job Search Notes & Preferences
## Last updated: like a week ago idk

### What I'm Looking For
- **comp**: ideally $200k+ base, but flexible for the right role/company. total comp (inc equity) matters more than base alone
- **location**: SF preferred, remote is great too. open to NYC if the offer is compelling. NOT interested in relocating to seattle or austin full-time (sorry acme/meridian)
- **role level**: senior or staff. not interested in going backwards to mid-level even for a "brand name" company
- **team size**: prefer smaller teams (5-15 eng). big orgs with 500-person eng teams feel too bureaucratic
- **tech**: want to work on distributed systems, infra, or developer tools. not interested in pure frontend or mobile work

### Deal Breakers
- no fully onsite roles (need at least 2 days remote/wk)
- no defense/government work (learned from the palantir experience)
- no companies with active layoff rounds
- need good eng culture - I want to write actual code, not just attend meetings

### Companies I'm Excited About (ranked-ish)
1. Stripe - payments is a fascinating problem space, great eng reputation
2. Notion - love the product, team seems great from what rachel described
3. Vercel - building the future of web infra, very cool
4. Linear - obsessed with their product design philosophy
5. Figma - real-time collab is hard and interesting
6. Supabase - open source, remote-first, cool technical challenges

### Companies I'm Less Excited About
- Meridian: culture seemed off on recruiter call. kevin seemed nice but the company feels very "enterprise startup"
- Palantir: already rejected + not interested in gov work
- Confluent: kafka is important but not where I want to spend my career

### Questions I Want to Ask in Interviews
- what does a typical week look like for someone on the team?
- how do you handle technical debt? what % of time is spent on it?
- what's the oncall situation like?
- how are technical decisions made? top-down or bottom-up?
- what's the biggest eng challenge the team is facing right now?
- can you tell me about a recent project that didn't go well? what happened?

### Negotiation Notes
- jordan says ALWAYS negotiate (he's right)
- use competing offers as leverage
- stripe offer: 225k + 5000 RSUs + 30k sign-on. want to push equity up
- datadog offer: 220k + 180k RSUs + 25k sign-on. remote is a big plus
- DEADLINE: stripe offer expires ~10 business days from jan 15... so like jan 29? need to check
  UPDATE: asked maya for extension, she said they can give until feb 21
- should I wait for figma before deciding? jordan thinks yes

### Random Thoughts
- feeling burned out from interview prep. the system design rounds are exhausting
- should I consider the portugal remote work thing jordan mentioned? datadog being remote-friendly makes that possible
- need to update my portfolio site... it still says "Software Engineer at Streamline Data" lol
- that robinhood rejection stung. i thought the onsite went well. lesson learned: you never know
- NOTE TO SELF: notion interview is feb 20th, DON'T FORGET to prep for the product sense round
- maybe i should just stay at cloudscale? no. the growth ceiling is real and i need a change

### Salary Research
- levels.fyi says senior at stripe: ~$220-250k base, $300-400k TC
- blind has some datapoints for datadog: $200-230k base, TC varies wildly
- notion seems lower on comp but great culture/product
- should factor in RSU vesting schedule. 4-year with 1-year cliff is standard but the stock price matters A LOT

### Timeline
- stripe offer deadline: feb 21 (extended)
- notion onsite: feb 20
- figma decision: waiting (said end of week, it's been 10 days now...)
- acme tech screen: feb 19
- need to make a decision by end of february probably
